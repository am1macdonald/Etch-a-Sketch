Hi,

Thanks for taking a look at my Etch-a-Sketch Project!

This is a project in the 'Fundamentals' track of "The Odin Project".

# The Odin Project 
## Etch-a-Sketch

>"...a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch." 
- from the [Foundations curriculum ](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

## What I Learned

This project gave me the chance to really develop my knowledge of the DOM and event listeners. Using loops to draw the grids for the game space, I was able to quickly and efficiently give every square on my grid the ability to change its style attribute on a mouse-over.

This project also gave me an opportunity to gain more familiarity with CSS and get things looking nice, centered and responisve. Responsiveness is especially important to me because it means more people get to use the tools I will create in the future.
